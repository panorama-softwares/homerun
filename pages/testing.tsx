        <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl pb-10">WHY IS SOFTWARE TESTING IMPORTANT?</h1>
        <p>Testing improves the efficiency, productivity, engagement, and interactivity of your product. A product gains market stability and sustenance after thorough testing. Quality Assurance is an important aspect of product development, and releasing a product without thorough testing would almost always result in failure.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve observed instances where product owners are unwilling to spend additional money on the QA process because they want simply casual testing. It is a common misconception that everyone can perform testing.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Testing necessitates professionalism, and if you do not have a competent team to test your product, you may forget about its success. Testing increases the value of a product while lowering the risk of it being damaged. Let&rsquo;s have a conversation about the testing demand.</p>

            <li className="font-semibold text-3xl pb-10">PRODUCT QUALITY </li>
            <p>The technical team creates software after gathering client needs. Following that, the testing team uses several techniques of testing to ensure that it is compatible with all devices and resolutions.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>After testing, a product&rsquo;s condition grows more powerful and outstanding. Only if a product is capable of serving quality will it be able to survive in the market.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The QA team validates the application&rsquo;s performance across a variety of operating systems, browsers, and mobile devices throughout testing. The testing team ensures that all of the fundamentals are followed and that the product&rsquo;s quality is fully justified.</p>
            <li className="font-semibold text-3xl py-10">SATISFACTION</li>
            <p>The testing team makes every effort to keep end-user satisfaction high. They examine an application&rsquo;s performance from the standpoint of its users. Users should feel at ease when using the programme.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The testing team ensures that the application is easy to use and understand. The public prefers to utilise applications that are quick and appealing, and the team ensures that this is the case throughout testing.</p>
            <li className="font-semibold text-3xl py-10">WHY SHOULDN&rsquo;T YOU OVERLOOK TESTING?</li>
            <p>If you fail to test your product, the following repercussions will occur:</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Money was squandered.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Users Trust is being eroded.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Damages are more likely to occur.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>It&rsquo;s a waste of time and effort.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Brand&rsquo;s Name will be spoiled.</p>
        </ol>

        <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl pb-10">CONCLUSION</h1>
        <p>Testing is a stand-alone stage in the software development process. During testing, all of the modules are thoroughly cross-verified. Raised bugs are forwarded to the development team for resolution, and the product is only released into the public realm after QA approves it.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>As a result, after the product has been developed while ensuring the client&rsquo;s requirements, it should be immediately handed over to the Quality Assurance department. When the development team has completed the product in accordance with the requirements document, the company begins testing.</p>
