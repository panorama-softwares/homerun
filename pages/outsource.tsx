    <h1 className="font-semibold text-3xl pb-5">WHY IS OUTSOURCING QA BENEFICIAL?</h1>
    <p>A professional QA team that separates software development from QA is a more effective and objective technique to ensure the quality of your code. The best approach to get started with outsourced software development is to outsource QA.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>You may have attempted outsourcing software development in the past with less than favourable outcomes, or you may have pondered outsourcing but been concerned that it would fail. However, there are significant advantages to QA outsourcing that produce exceptional results.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>In this blog we will tell you the advantages of outsourcing QA. </p>

      <li className="pt-20 pb-10 font-semibold text-3xl ">PROTECTION OF CODE</li>
      <p >When you outsource your software to QA outsourcing services, you don&rsquo;t give your outsourced partners access to the source code</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>They&rsquo;ll develop test plans and interact with software as if they were end users, without touching any code. You won&rsquo;t have to compromise on intellectual property this way.</p>
      <li className="py-10 font-semibold text-3xl">COST EFFICIENT</li>
      <p>When it comes to outsourcing any services, the most important element to consider is the cost. If you opt to create an in-house team, you&rsquo;ll need to pay professional testers&rsquo; wages as well as invest in IT infrastructure.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>You must also train your resources to meet your testing requirements. When you use QA outsourcing services, on the other hand, you can outsource the entire project for a fraction of the cost.</p>
      <li className="py-10 font-semibold text-3xl">FLEXIBLE RESOURCES</li>
      <p>When looking for a QA outsourcing firm in India, ensure the company you choose gives you complete control over resource selection.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>The outsourced QA team must be up to date on technological developments and be able to adapt them to the client&rsquo;s business application.</p>
      <li className="py-10 font-semibold text-3xl">DOMAIN EXPERTISE</li>
      <p>The most crucial benefit that QA outsourcing businesses may provide to your SDLC is the product quality in India</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>The quality assurance team spends the majority of their time learning about the domain throughout software development in order to become devoted domain experts in the industry.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>This enables them to evaluate your product in light of current market trends, languages, technologies, and dangers. Better, stronger goods that are relevant to current development are the consequence of QA outsourcing services.</p>
      <li className="py-10 font-semibold text-3xl">OBJECTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY </li>
      <p>Getting development and QA done by various teams or suppliers is an excellent way to retain objectivity while building your product and enhancing overall quality.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>In general, if a team or firm works on both development and QA, the objection must be removed. Applications for software will not be taken seriously. You run the danger of making mistakes or having them overlooked.</p>
      <li className="py-10 font-semibold text-3xl">BETTER PRODUCT</li>
      <p>You might believe that QA isn&rsquo;t really necessary, or that your team doesn&rsquo;t have enough testers to accomplish it. As a result, the QA phase of software development is generally skipped.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>However, it is critical to include QA outsourcing services as early as possible in the development process.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>You will have the ability to uncover issues before they become part of the software design by working with a QA outsourcing business in India early in the process.</p>
