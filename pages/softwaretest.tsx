    <h1 className='text-3xl font-semibold pb-10'>WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF SOFTWARE TESTING?</h1>
<p className='pb-10'>Software testing ensures that a program is operating in accordance with its specifications. The QA team uses manual testing and 
    automation testing to assess an application.<br></br></p>
    <p className='pb-10'>Testing is a crucial aspect of the software development process. The application
     will not be released into the public domain unless this is done.<br></br></p>
     <p className='pb-10'>Both methods of testing ensure that a program is stable, engaging, and user-friendly.<br></br></p>
     <p className='pb-10'>Testing, on the other hand, is a difficult task because every user has a different perspective and expectation. Also, 
     we understand that not everyone will appreciate your product, but we should do everything 
     we can to make it the best it can be.<br></br></p>
     <p className='pb-10'>As a result, we make your application user-friendly through quality testing so that the 
        largest number of people may enjoy it.<br></br></p>
